Welcome to our Guides section.

We cannot cover all details in our experiment section or present you with all the background knowledge required so everyone can understand all aspects of the experiments completly. That is why we wrote the guides presented in this section.

If you want to get a quick overview on some essential terms in the Natural Language Processing, just check out our [Basic Definitions](basic-definitions.mdx).

If you want to know more about the datasets we used for the experiments and how they are structured, check out the [Data Sets Guide](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/data-comparison)

You want to know how to work with these datasets and prepare them for indexing in evaluation with elasticsearch, check out our [Data Parsing for Elasticsearch Guide](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/how-to-parse)

If youre interested in seting up your own instance of Elasticsearch, to run bigger experiments or host your own service, the [Setup Elasticsearch Guide](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/elastic-setup) is for you.

We also have a guide on [Working with Notebooks](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/notebooks) and the [Ranking Evaluation API](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/ranking-api) of Elasticsearch.
