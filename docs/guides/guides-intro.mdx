Welcome to our Guides section.

In order to reproduce all our experiments, we provide you some guides on [How to Parse](how-to-parse.mdx), [How to Setup Elasticsearch](elastic-setup.mdx), [How to Work with Notebooks](notebooks.mdx) and many other. 

If you want to get a quick overview on some essential terms in the Natural Language Processing, just check out our [Basic Definitions](basic-definitions.mdx).
