## ADI
 
**Description:**<br />An extremely small data set containing fewer than 100 examples. It does not  offer many prospects beyond experimenting with machine learning on small data sets.
 
**Documents:**<br />The file `ADI.ALL` contains eighty-three (83) documents with the same notation as `Cranfield`.
 
*Example:*
```
.I 3
.T
an important need and opportunity for a. d. i. leadership
in information science education .
.A
R. L. TAYLOR
.W
current trends in information science education
appear inadequate for the important need of the nation's
practicing professional personnel for training in becoming
information specialists or more proficient users of
 information systems .  a particular educational program
 by a. d. i. is suggested to supplement others in meeting
 this presumptive need .
```
 
**Queries:**<br />`ID (.I)`holds 35 short queries that seem to be test questions.
 
*Example:*
```
.I 3
.W
What is information science?  Give definitions where possible.
```
 
**Relevance assessments:**<br />The relevance assessments, given in `ADI.REL`, are in the same format as `CISI` & `CACM`. Query-ID followed by relevant document- ID followed by `0` and `0.0`. Could be used to create trainable vectors.
 
*Example:*
```
3   3   0   0.000000

## CACM
 
**Description:**<br />CACM is a collection of article abstracts, published in ACM journal between 1958 and 1979.
It is often claimed that it is too small to observe real impact.
 
**Documents:**<br />In `cacm.all` contains 3,204 labeled entries. Each label is marked specifically with a `.` followed by a letter. They appear in an entry in the following order:<br />
(.I) ID <br />
(.T) Title <br />
(.W) Abstract <br />
(.B) Publication date of the article <br />
(.A) Author list <br />
(.N) Information when entry was added <br />
(.X) List of cross-references to other documents <br />

Multiprogramming STRETCH: Feasibility Considerations
.W
The tendency towards increased parallelism in
computers is noted.  Exploitation of this parallelism
presents a number of new problems in machine design
and in programming systems.  Minimum requirements
for successful concurrent execution of several independent
problem programs are discussed.  These requirements
are met in the STRETCH system by a carefully balanced
combination of built-in and programmed logic. 
Techniques are described which place the burden of the
programmed logic on system programs (supervisory
program and compiler) rather than on problem programs.

The list of cross-references shows the reference ID followed by `4`, `5` or `6` and marked with the doc-ID at the end. The three numbers define the references more precisely:
 
```
4: "bibliographic coupling" - if document id Y appears in the bibliographic
    coupling subvector for document X with a weight of w, it means X
    and Y have w common references in their bibliographies; the weight
    of did X in the vector for X is the number of items in X's bibliography.
5: "links" - documents X and Y are linked if X cites Y, Y cites X, or
    X == Y.
6: "co-citations" - if document id Y appears in the co-citation subvector
    for document X with weight w, it means X and Y are cited together in
    w documents; the weight of did X in the vector for X is the number
    of documents that cite X.
```
 
**Queries:**<br /> The file `query.text` contains sixty-four (64) query sentences, which also use the same markers as the text.
 
*Example:*
```
.I 10
.W

**Relevance assessments:**<br />In `qrels.text` query ID is followed by doc-ID followed by 0 int and 0.0 float. Every doc has it's own row and can be used as a trainable vector.
 
*Example:*
```
10 0046  0 0
10 0141  0 0
10 0392  0 0

**Other files:**
* `cite.info` - Key to citation info
* `common_words` - Stop words used by smart
* `qrels.text` - List of relevance judgments
 
**Parsing problems**:<br />
* Documents - Not all entries contain information on author and text. Those tags Will not be present if there is no information available.

## CISI
 
**Description:**<br />The CISI collection is very similar to the CACM collection and uses the same notations.
 
**Documents:**<br /> The file `CISI.ALL` contains 1,460 texts. For a detailed explanation on the notation see the `CACM` section.

Abstracting Concepts and Methods
.A
Borko, H.
.W
     Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a
how-to-do-it course.
It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts,
the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing
industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the
preparation and evaluation of the product.
These topics we call concepts.
     The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing
various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications.
These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the
appendix.
There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.
     Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we
believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the
past.
Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship.
Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of
computer-prepared abstracts and extracts.
Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this
research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text,
select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts.
The benefits of this research are discussed.
    Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry.
Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or
volunteer workers.
Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know
they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.
One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.

**Queries:**<br />112 queries are stored in `CISI.QRY`. The notation is the same as in CAMC.
 
*Example:*
```
.I 21
.W
The need to provide personnel for the information field.
```
 
**Relevance assessments:**<br />In `CISI.REL` query ID is followed by doc-ID followed by 0 int and 0.0 float. Every document has its own row and can be used as a trainable vector.
 
*Example:*
```
    21      6 0 0.000000
    21     14 0 0.000000
    21     22 0 0.000000

    21    392 0 0.000000
    21    400 0 0.000000
```
 
**Other files:**<br />`CISI.BLN` - List of boolean queries
 
**Parsing problems**:<br />
* Documents - Some entries contain more than one author, presenting us with more than one author tag.
* Documents - Not every entry has information on the publication date, those tags will not be present if there is no information available.

## Cranfield
 
**Description:**<br />Cranfield uses the same notation as `CACM` and `CISI`, but the relevance evaluations are more detailed and more specific to the query tasks. To use this collection it is important to note that the ID of the queries, e.g. `.I 002`, is not the same query-ID used in the relevance assessments. It seems that the query-IDs come from the order in the file. It may be helpful to update the IDs before working with them to avoid confusion.
 
**Documents:**<br />The File `cran.all` holds 1,400 documents, for detailed notation see the `CACM`section. In contrast to `CACM` and `CISI` there are no cross-references to other documents listed.
 
*Example:*
```
.I 5
.T
one-dimensional transient heat conduction into a double-layer
slab subjected to a linear heat input for a small time
internal .

j. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 924.
.W
one-dimensional transient heat conduction into a double-layer
slab subjected to a linear heat input for a small time
internal .
  analytic solutions are presented for the transient heat
conduction in composite slabs exposed at one surface to a
triangular heat rate .  this type of heating rate may occur, for
example, during aerodynamic heating .
```
 
**Queries:**<br />The File `cran.qury` contains 225 queries; mostly questions, with some queries being term searches. The ID at the beginning of every query is not the reference-ID which is used in `cranqrel`.
 
*Example:*
```
.I 004
.W
what problems of heat conduction in composite slabs have been solved so
far .
```
 
**Relevance assessments:**<br />Every row in `cranqrel` holds a query-ID, relevant document-ID and the relevancy code (1,2,3,4 or 5). Every document has its own row. The relevancy codes are defined as follows:
 
1: References which are a complete answer to the question.<br />
2: References of a high degree of relevance, the lack of which either would have made the research impracticable or would have resulted in a considerable amount of extra work.<br />
3: References which were useful, either as general background to the work or as suggesting methods of tackling certain aspects of the work.<br />
4: References of minimum interest, for example, those that have been included from an historical viewpoint.<br />
5: References of no interest.<br />
 
*Example:*

## LISA
 
**Description:**<br /> The LISA collection, contributed in 1982 by Peter Willett of Sheffield University, is being provided to support research investigations.
It is punctuated by clear stop marks making the data structure easy to understand. The queries appear to be very specific and quite long.
 
**Documents:**<br />There are a total of 6,004 labeled abstracts stored in files `LISA0.001` to `LISA5.850`. The beginning of every entry is marked by an unique ID followed by the title. Some title line entries also display information about the author, time, and place. A row of 44  `*`s separates the entries.

*Example:*
```
Document 5640
NORDINFO COURSE IN BIBLIOMETRICS, 1981-10-26-29, HANASSARI, HELSINKI,
SWEDISH-FINNISH CULTURAL CENTRE (IN SWEDISH).

DESCRIBES THE DISCIPLINE OF BIBLIOMETRICS WITH REFERENCE TO A NORDINFO COURSE
ATTENDED IN HELSINKI. DEFINES BIBLIOMETRICS AS QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF
LIBRARY TECHNIQUES. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE USED ON A GLOBAL SCALE, BUT
THEY CAN ALSO BE A TOOL TO CALCULATE THE BEST USE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY'S
RESOURCES. AMONG THE EMPIRICAL LAWS DEVELOPED, BRADFORD'S LAW IS THE MOST
APPLICABLE. DESCRIBES THE USE OF THIS LAW TO OBTAIN A GRAPH WITH AN
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING PART, A SO-CALLED BRADFORD GRAPH. THIS CAN SHOW THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUTHORS AND NUMBER OF ARTICLES, ARTICLES AND QUOTATIONS
AND CAN HELP TO DETERMINE THE PROCESS OF OBSOLESCENCE OF LITERATURE IN A
LIBRARY. OTHER BIBLIOMETRIC LAWS ARE THOSE OF LOTKA AND ZIPF. THE METHODS ARE
USEFUL IN ACQUISITION, PLANNING OF SPACE ALLOCATION, WITHDRAWALS, LIBRARY USE,
AND OTHER AREAS OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION.
********************************************
```

**Queries:**<br />Thirty-five (35) queries are stored in file `LISA.QUE`. The query-ID is followed by several long sentences, all of which are written from a first person perspective, expressing interest in certain topics. The entries are separated by `#`.

*Example:*
```
24
I AM INTERESTED IN ALMOST ANYTHING TO DO WITH AUTOMATIC DOCUMENT
CLASSIFICATION: SEARCH STRATEGIES FOR HIERARCHICAL AND NON-HIERARCHICAL
CLUSTERS, CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS, THE CREATION OF CLUSTER REPRESENTATIVES,
RETRIEVAL EXPERIMENTS USING CLUSTERED FILES AND MEASURES OF
INTER-DOCUMENT SIMILARITY. RELATED TO THIS IS AN INTEREST IN TERM
CLASSIFICATIONS, THEIR APPLICATION IN RETRIEVAL, INTER-TERM SIMILARITIES
ETC. AUTOMATIC DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION, CLUSTERS, CLUSTERING, TERM
CLASSIFICATIONS. #
```

**Relevance assessments:**<br />Relevance assessments, represented by unique IDs, are stored in `LISARJ.NUM`.  Every query-ID (first column) is followed by the number of relevant document-IDs.. Depending on the program used to open or parse the file, the relevant document-IDs could continue into the next line. Since there is no end marker it would be best to parse the lines depending on the query-ID and number of relevant document-IDs.

*Example:*
```
           1           2        3392        3396                                
           2           2        2623        4291                                
           3           5        1407        1431        3794        3795        
        3796                                                                    
           4           7         604        3527        4644        5087        
        5112        5113        5295                                            
           5           1        3401  
```

**Other files:**<br />The `LISA.REL` file is an old version of the relevance assessments which helps in understanding the new version, but provides no further meaningful information.
 
**Parsing problems**:<br />
* Documents - All documents are stored in separate files with only the newline marking the separate ID, title, and text. This has presented unique problems.
* Relevance Assessments -  These are not parseable line by line, the number of relevant documents should be used to parse.

## Medline
 
**Description:**<br />A document collection of short medical articles with very specific queries.
 
**Documents:**<br />The file `MED.ALL` holds 1,033 articles with a notation similar to `Cranfield` but with less information. Only the document-ID (.I) and the text (.W) are marked.
 
*Example:*
```
.I 1
.W
correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free
fatty acids .                                                          
  correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of  
glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery .    
significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal  
glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of
the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it      
appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly
dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at        
delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .
```
 
**Queries:**<br /> Thirty (30) specific queries are stored in `MED.QRY`. The notation is (.I) for the query-ID and (.W) for the query text. More than one sentence is possible and can be separated with `.`.
 
*Example:*
```
.I 5
.W
 the crossing of fatty acids through the placental barrier.  normal
fatty acid levels in placenta and fetus.
```
 
**Relevance assessments:**<br /> For every row of `MED.REL` the query ID is followed by a `0` which separates it from the relevant doc ID. At the end of every row is a `1`. There is a row for every query ID, in combination with the relevant doc ID.
 
*Example:*
```
5 0 1 1
5 0 2 1
5 0 4 1
5 0 5 1
5 0 6 1
5 0 7 1
5 0 8 1
5 0 9 1
5 0 10 1
5 0 11 1
5 0 12 1
```
 
**Other files:**<br />`MED.REL.OLD` - An older version of relevance assessments. Here the IDs are followed by `0`and `0.000000` and can be used as trainable embeddings.
 
**Source:** http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/medl/

## NPL
 
**Description:**<br />This collection was contributed by Vaswani and Cameron at the  National Physical Laboratory in the UK in 1970.
The end marker structure is consistent for every file, even though it lacks context to engage with in a pragmatic search.
 
**Documents:**The files `doc-text` & `doc-vecs` contain 11,429 entries. `doc-text` provides them in text form with unique IDs which match the vector representation of the terms in the `doc-vecs` file. Every entry ends with `/`.
 
*Example:*
```
141
some aspects of the logical and circuit design of a digital field

problems is described  by making calculations at all the lattice
points of the field simultaneously computation time is greatly reduced

```
*Same text represented as a vector, in a different order, and without irrelevant terms:*
```
141     3     5     7    23    27    33    34    42    54    71

  534   582   597   626  1215 /
```
 
**Queries:**<br /> Ninety-three (93) queries are stored in `query-text` & `query-vecs` as both text and vector representation. The ID is followed by the query, and the entry is finished with a `/` mark.
 
*Example:*
```
3
USE OF DIGITAL COMPUTERS IN THE DESIGN OF BAND PASS FILTERS HAVING GIVEN PHASE AND ATTENUATION CHARACTERISTICS
/
```
 
*Same query represented as a vector, in a different order, and without irrelevant terms:*
```
  3  1  10  23  35  71  76  77  97  191  224
  309  360 /
```
 
**Relevance Assessments:**<br />In `rlv-ass` the query IDs are followed by the relevant document IDs. The entries are separated by `/`.
 
*Example:*
```
3
  141   148   813  1610  2429  3059  3272  3398  3614  3688

10174 10484 10486
   /
```
 
**Other files:**
* `term-vocab` contains vocabulary stems with representative IDs. The end marker is `/`
* `term-vecs` contains the occurrences of search terms in the docs. The first ID is always the vocab ID, followed by all of the document IDs in which the terms occurred. The end marker is `/`
* `term-mst` contains word IDs, followed by context-word IDs, followed by co-occurrences and mutual similarity values. This is only available for words which occured in at least 2 documents
 
**Parsing problems**:<br />
* The number of spaces between the separator `/` and the entries are different between documents, queries, and relevance assessments.
* Relevance Assessments: there are many spaces and newlines to remove before getting the raw numbers.

## Time
 
**Description:**<br /> This collection contains 423 articles from TIME Magazines of the 1960's. With only 423 documents it is a rather small data set. Problems with the labeling are once again present. The IDs used in the relevance assessments do not correlate with the unique text numbers that mark the start of a document.
 
**Documents:**<br />The file `TIME.ALL` stores 423 documents, the first of which is labeled as `*TEXT 017` and the last one `*TEXT 563`. Every document starts with a line that specifies text, date, and page number. The lines are followed by sentences of unlabeled text. The example is shortened as the articles are quite long.
 
*Example:*
```
*TEXT 017 01/04/63 PAGE 020

## Other Data Sets

### Europarl Parallel Corpus
 
**Description:**<br /> Starting in 2001, the corpus collected texts with up to 60 million words per language. Texts were extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament for these 21 European languages: <br />
Romanic (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian), Germanic (English, Dutch, German, Danish, Swedish), Slavik (Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, Slovene), Finni-Ugric (Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian), Baltic (Latvian, Lithuanian), and Greek.
 
**Documents:**<br />Every file has the same structure; there are sections separated with the tag `<CHAPTER ID=?>` which are followed by the title of the chapter. The `<SPEAKER ID =??>` is a unique ID which marks the spoken part.
 
*Example from the English Corpus:*
```
<CHAPTER ID=6>
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
<SPEAKER ID=80 NAME="President">
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].

### OHSUMED
 
**Description:**<br /> This collection was originally created by William Hersh as a new large medical test collection for experiments on the SMART retrieval system. It was later divided intoTraining andTest sets. <br />
The split documents contain 20,000 abstracts, while the unsplit documents contain 50,216; both collections are sorted into 23 medical categories. Since the official source is no longer available online, we will refer to the download files by Alessandro Moschitti.
 
**Documents:**<br />The file `Cardiovascular Diseases Abstract` contains 20,000 documents divided into Training and Test set directories. Inside those directories are 23 folders which represent each of the 23 categories the abstracts are assigned to. Every document is written in a file without special notation.
 
*Example:*
```
Haemophilus influenzae meningitis with prolonged hospital course.
 A retrospective evaluation of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis observed over a 2-year period documented 86 cases.
 Eight of these patients demonstrated an unusual clinical course characterized by persistent fever (duration: greater than 10 days), cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, profound meningeal enhancement on computed tomography, significant morbidity, and a prolonged hospital course.
 The mean age of these 8 patients was 6 months, in contrast to a mean age of 14 months for the entire group.
 Two patients had clinical evidence of relapse.
 Four of the 8 patients tested for latex particle agglutination in the cerebrospinal fluid remained positive after 10 days.
 All patients received antimicrobial therapy until they were afebrile for a minimum of 5 days.
 Subsequent neurologic examination revealed a persistent seizure disorder in 5 patients (62.5%), moderate-to-profound hearing loss in 2 (25%), mild ataxia in 1 (12.5%), and developmental delay with hydrocephalus which required shunting in 1 (12.5%).
 One patient had no sequelae.

### Reuters 21578
 
**Description:**<br /> This collection was originally gathered and labeled by Carnegie Group, Inc. and Reuters, Ltd. Further information is available in the `README.txt` document. <br />
The files are in SGML format, therefore it is important to understand that particular markup language first. 
It is already split into `Training` and `Test` sets by the tag `LEWISSPLIT`. Topics and relations between them are well documented, which makes this collection a very useful one for pragmatic search development. However, it must be noted that only half of the documents were manually assigned to topics, so there are unlabeled documents which are marked by `LEWISSPLIT="NOT-USED"`.<br />
The collection is a multi-labeled one, as such one document can be assigned to more than one topic.
 
**Documents:**<br />
The files `reut2-000.sgm` to `reut2-021.sgm` contain 21,578 documents that are in SGML format. The start of every document is marked with
```<!DOCTYPE lewis SYSTEM "lewis.dtd">```
The entries are clearly distinguishable by their notation.
 
*Example:*
```
<REUTERS TOPICS="BYPASS" LEWISSPLIT="TRAIN" CGISPLIT="TRAINING-SET" OLDID="2984" NEWID="14001">

<TITLE>JOHANNESBURG GOLD SHARES CLOSE MIXED TO FIRMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold share prices closed mixed to
slightly firmer in quiet and cautious trading, showing little
reaction to a retreat in the bullion price back to below 420
dlrs and a firmer financial rand, dealers said.
    Heavyweight Vaal Reefs ended eight rand higher at 398 rand
but Grootvlei eased 40 cents at 16.60 rand, while mining
financials had Gold Fields up a rand at 63 rand despite weaker
quarterly results. Other minings were firm but platinums eased.
    Industrials also closed mixed to firmer, the index once
again hitting a new high of 1757 from Friday's 1753 finish. The
overall index also hit a new high of 2188 versus 2179 on
Friday.

The attributes specified after `<REUTERS ` are meant to identify documents and groups of
documents, and have the following meanings:
 
```     
    1. TOPICS: The possible values are YES, NO, and BYPASS:
        a. YES indicates that (in the original data) there was at
                        least one entry in the TOPICS fields.
        b. NO indicates that (in the original data) the story had no
                        entries in the TOPICS field.
        c. BYPASS indicates that (in the original data) the story was
                        marked with the string "bypass" (or a typographical variant on that
                        string).
                        Although this shouldn't be used for Topic search because there could be topics even if there is a NO, or likewise, there could be be no topics even if there is a YES.
 
    2. LEWISSPLIT : The possible values are TRAINING, TEST, and
                        NOT-USED. 
        a. TRAINING indicates that it was used in training sets in the
                        experiments reported in LEWIS91d (Chapters 9 and 10), LEWIS92b,
                        LEWIS92e, and LEWIS94b. 
        b. TEST indicates it was used in the test set
                        for those experiments.
        c. NOT-USED means it was not used in those
                        experiments.
 
     3. CGISPLIT : The possible values are TRAINING-SET and
                        PUBLISHED-TESTSET indicating whether the document was in the training
                        set or the test set for the experiments reported in HAYES89 and
                        HAYES90b.
 
     4. OLDID : The identification number (ID) the story had in the
                        Reuters-22173 collection.
 
     5. NEWID : The identification number (ID) the story has in the
                        Reuters-21578, Distribution 1.0 collection. These IDs are assigned to
                        the stories in chronological order.

### TREC
 
**Description:**<br />TREC (the TExt REtrieval Conference) is not just one collection, but is instead a conference which has been held regularly since 1992. The TREC workshop series - among other goals - tries to encourage research in IR, based on large test collections, and increase the communication amid IR research and development.<br />
TREC has produced many test collections, all of which contain a set of documents, a set of topics (questions), and a set of relevance judgments (answers). The collections can be downloaded from the TREC website but are usually copyrighted and must be licensed. The process to license a collection can be found on the data page entry for the collection of interest (https://trec.nist.gov/data.html).<br />
The collections cover various interests such as “Chemical IR”, “Conversational Assistance”, “Legal”, “Medical” ,”News”, “Spoken Document Retrieval”, etc.
One very interesting thing about this collection is its constant growth and high standards regarding having a homogeneous notation. This can be very helpful for developing and testing NLP processing algorithms.<br />
They also provide tools to process the data.
Publications about TREC are published by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and are accessible here: http://trec.nist.gov/pubs.html
Since there are many different data sets, we provide no examples given for this collection.
