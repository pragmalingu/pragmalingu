## 1. What is Pragmatics?

Pragmatics is difficult to define in concrete terms. In linguistic research, there are various approaches to how pragmatics can be approached. 

On the one hand there is the Anglo-American component view on pragmatics, where pragmatics is defined as: 
>Pragmatics is the systematic study of meaning by virtue, or dependent on, the use of language. (Huang 2007, 2013c, 2014:2, 2016)

Within this approach pragmatics exist in a linguistic theory where there are a number of core components like phonetics, phonology, morphology, synatx and semantics. Thomas C. Scott-Phillips illustrated this approach within his essay **"Pragmatics and the aims of language evolution"**:

He defines pragmatics as the outermost and thus the most abstract layer of a language. According to Scott, pragmatics carries the meaning of a statement in the context of the conversation.

On the other hand there is the European Continental view on pragmatics, where pragmatics is defined as:
> Pragmatic is a general function (i.e. cognitive, social, and cultural) perspective on linguistic phenomena in relation to their usage in forms of behaviour. (Verschueren 1999:7, 11, 1995:12)

We can profit from both of these approaches to get an understanding of the concept pragmatics.

As a conclusion we can create this very simple definition:
>Pragmatics is the study of language use in context.

In order to understand pragmatic contexts, it is not enough to just look at a sentence, it is always necessary to consider the contextual circumstances as well.
In this article will use mostly the Anglo-American structure to explain some of the central concepts of pragmatics.

## 2. Central concepts of pragmatics

To find a useful way to handle the language given pragmatic concepts in Information Retrieval and NLP in general, we have to find rules to represent those concepts. In order to do that it is helpful to categorize them given the situation they appear in. 

"The Oxford Handbook of Pragmatics" tries to divide pragmatics into the following central concepts: 

* Conversational Implicature
* Presupposition
* Speech Acts
* Deixis
* Reference
* Context

In the following, we will briefly explain those concepts using examples and then use those to explain why pragmatic search is still a major problem in Natural Language Processing.

### 2.1. Conversational Implicature
The conversational implicature can be defined as an additional meaning of an statement that is not apparent from the literal meaning but must be inferred from the context. 

*For example:*
>A: "I'm out of milk." <br></br>
>B: "There's a supermarket next door."

The answer B gives A doesn't make sense if you're not aware of the fact, that you can find milk inside a supermarket. Therefor it is implicated by B that A has this knowledge and knows what to do with it concerning A's sentence.

This shows that a conversational implicature is part of what a speaker means, but not part of what the sentence means.

The *implicature* shouldn't be mixed up with the term  *implication*. *Implication* is a term used in semantics to represent connections that can be concluded without any context but from having some basic knowledge. 

*For example:*
> "The cat lies on the carpet."

This implies that the carpet lies under the cat. The only knowledge we need to comprehend this implication is, how to revert this sentence semantically. 

Paul Grice's defined the cooperative principle through his pragmatic theory and introduced its attendant maxims of conversation in his book "Studies in the Way of Words", 1989. **The cooperative principle** implies that when we communicate, we are effective and cooperative and assume the same from our conversational partner. The four maxims are rules which can predict how to stay true to the cooperative principle:

1. **Maxim of quantity** is about being informative. 
<br></br>One should make their utterance as informative as the current conversation purpose requires, but not more than that.
2. **Maxim of quality** is about being truthful. 
<br></br>This means one shouldn't say anything they think is false, but also shouldn't say anything they can't give adequate reasons for its truth.
3. **Maxim of relation** is about being relevant. 
<br></br>One shouldn't say anything that isn't relevant to the conversation.
4. **Maxim of manner** is about being clear. 
<br></br>This means obscure language, ambiguity, prolixity should be avoided and proper language used.

By following the cooperative principle we're able to make conclusions and thus implicature. 
Often those maxims are broken on purpose, to get a specific effect.

1. **Violation of the quantity maxim**
* Tautologies: "It is what it is", "voll und ganz"
2. **Violation of the quality maxim**
* Irony/sarkasm: "Oh great..."
* Understatement/overstatement: "I was barely drunk after all.", "This will take ages."
* Lying
3. **Violation of the relation maxim**
* Sudden change of subject
* Evasion: "What is the capital of Germany?" - "It is not Paris."
4. **Violation of the manner maxim**
* Euphemism: "I'm not mad. I'm just ... well, differently moraled, that's all."
* Obscure language: "Where were you? Did you get milk?" - "Maybe I did, maybe I didnt't."

These maxims are not an ideal categorization but they can help to understand implicature and to determine the problems with it in NLP.

### 2.2. Presupposition

Presupposition can be defined as the implicit assumption that the counterpart has a certain knowledge about a given statement.

*Examples:*

* Lisa stopped going to the gym.<br></br>
Presupposition: *Lisa was going to the gym.*
* Are you vegan now?<br></br>
Presupposition: *You didn't eat vegan before.*
* Did you meet up with Louisa?<br></br>
Presupposition: *Louisa exists.*

Linguistic research tries to distinguish between semantic and pragmatic presupposition. While the semantic presupposition focuses on the truth of a statement, the pragmatic presupposition is concerned with whether a statement is adapted to the world knowledge of the counterpart.

Thus, in the case of "Joe Biden won the US election." the semantic presupposition would be that there is a person named "Joe Biden" and that there is an election in the US. The pragmatic presupposition, on the other hand, would be that the writer of the sentence assumes that the receiver knows who Joe Biden is.

It is often difficult to separate the semantic and pragmatic presuppositions because they often go together. Therefore, it is useful to consider both equally.

To detect a presupposition in written text, one can look for certain lexical items or linguistic constructors that trigger a presupposition. 
The following were defined by Stephen C. Levinson in his book "Pragmatics":

| Presupposition trigger      | Description | Example | Presupposition |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Definite descriptions       | A noun-phrase or a singular common noun with a proper description. | "The king of France is old."           | There is exactly one person who is the king of France. |
| Factive verbs               | Verbs that assume that their object, mostly subclauses, are a fact. (e.g. be aware of, regret that, realized that, be sorry that, be glad that, etc.) | "Julia realized that she was in debt." | Julia is in fact in debt. |
| Implicative verbs           | Verbs that imply an underlying attempt. (e.g. happened that, managed to, forgot to, avoided to, etc.) | "The politician did not win the election." | The politician ran for office. |
| Change of state             | Verbs that imply a change of a previous situation. (e.g. start, finish, etc.) | "He stopped smoking." | He did smoke before. |
| Iteratives                  | These imply a previous existence of a situation. (e.g. again, another time, return, repeat, etc.)    | "They met again."    | They met once before.   |
| Temporal clauses            | Clauses that explain background situation on the following sentence. (e.g. after, during, while, since, before, etc.)     | "While she was working, he was sick at home."   | She is working.   |
| Cleft sentences             | Sentences that highlight certain information and declare it as background informative.    | "It was not Andrea, who murdered Harold."   | Harold has been murdered.   |
| Comparisons and contrasts   | Comparative constructions can imply background information about the compared object.    | "He is an even better golf player than Tiger Woods."   | Tiger Woods is a golf player.   |
| Counterfactual conditionals | Implying that something happened by negating it.   | "If she hadn't missed the stop sign, she'd still be here."   | She did miss the stop sign.   |
| Questions                   | Specific questions that are phrased to get a concrete answer.    | "Who is the Queen of England?"   | There is someone who is Queen of England.   |
| Possessive case             | Relations can imply the background information about possession.    | "Rosie's dog is very cute."   |  Rosie has a dog.  |

These triggers can be a helpful clue while processing texts that include presuppositions. The transitions between  pragmatic concepts can be fluid, as already mentioned in the previous section.

### 2.3. Speech Acts

der Sprecher mit dem, was er sagt, eine bestimmte Handlung intendiert.

Searle (1969) unterscheidet in Anlehnung an Austin(1962) vier Akte, die mit dem Sprechen als Kommunikation verbunden sind:

Der Äußerungsakt Den Akt der Äußerung: 
Peter raucht. [pe:tɚ rauʊχt].

Der propositionale Akt Den Akt, sich auf Dinge zu beziehen (Referenz) und diesen Eigenschaften zuzuschreiben (Prädikation):
Referenz auf Peter und Zuschreibung der Eigenschaft des Rauchens.

Der illokutionäre Akt: Die Funktion, welche Prädikationsakte in der Kommunikation einnehmen: Behaupten,
Erfragen, Befehlen, Versprechen usw.:
Behauptung, dass Peter raucht.

Der perlokutionäre Akt: Konsequenzen und Auswirkungen von illokutionären Akten:
 Adressat glaubt, dass Peter raucht.


Die Klassifikation von Sprechakten (Searle 1969)

Repräsentativa (Verpflichtet auf die Wahrheit der ausgedrückten Proposition): 
„Es schneit gerade.“
Direktiva (Versuch  eine Handlung hervorzurufen) :
 „Heb das bitte wieder auf!“
Kommissiva (Verpflichten  auf eine zukünftige Handlung):  
„Versprich mir, dass du das nicht wieder tust.“
Expressiva (Drücken einen psychischen Zustand aus ):
„Vielen Dank für deine Hilfe.“
Deklarativa (Führen zu einem Wechsel eines Zustands einer Entität im Gefüge gesellschaftlicher Institutionen) :
„Ich kündige!“
Eine wichtige Unterklasse sind repräsentative Deklarationen, die den Wahrheitswert einer Proposition betreffen:
“ Jemanden schuldig finden, jemanden krank schreiben.”


### 2.4. Reference and Deixis

Since reference and deixis are very close topics we decided to summerize them into one section. A reference is always dependent on the sentence in which it appears and can't be understood without context.

For example:
> "Are you there yet?" - "No, I'm still at the cafe."

Without any more information it is for example impossible to know where exactly "there" is.
We can divide the pragmatic reference in two categries:
* Anaphoric reference
* Deictic reference

**Anaphoric reference**


**Deictic reference**

Deixis (​/⁠ˈdɛɪ̯ksɪs⁠/​ zu altgriechisch δείκνυμι deíknymi „zeigen“), auch Indexikalität
Personaldeixis: betrifft die Identität der Gesprächspartner (Pronominalsystem): “ich, du, er, sie, …”
Sozialdeixis: Anredeformen ‚Sie‘, ‚du‘, ‚meine Damen und Herren‘
Temporaldeixis: betrifft die zeitliche Orientierung: “heute, gestern, morgen, …”
Lokaldeixis: betrifft die räumliche Orientierung, Unterscheidung in positionales (“hier, da, dort, …”) und dimensionales Referenzsystem (“vor, hinter, links, rechts, über, unter, ….”)
Text- und Diskursdeixis: bezieht sich auf Teile des vorangehenden oder folgenden Textes: “Was ich damit sagen will, ist Folgendes...”
Speziell Lokal- und Zeitdeixis können je nach Sprache stark variieren. Beispiel: Japanisch hat koko, soko, asoko je nach Sprecherposition.

Anaphorik (vgl. griech. ἀναφέρειν, anapherein, „herauftragen“, auch „auf etw. beziehen“),  Anapher
Verweis auf vorangegangenen Satzteil:
Bsp.: „Ich habe vorhin Lena getroffen. Sie sah richtig entspannt aus.“ — „Das habe ich mir auch gedacht. Ich glaube sie ist gerade aus dem Urlaub zurück.“
seltenerer Fall des Vorverweisens, kataphorische Referenz, Katapher
Bsp: “Ich hätte es wissen müssen: Die Aufgabe ist einfach zu schwer.”
Weitere nicht-deiktische Referenzen:
Eigennamen (“Montblanc, Struppi”) 
definite Kennzeichnungen (“der höchste Berg Europas, der Hund von Tim”)
Gattungsnamen (“Katze”) oder Substanznamen (“Milch”), erst in Verbindung mit anderen referentiellen Ausdrücken referenzfähig (“unsere Katze”, “die Milch dort drüben”).


### 2.6. Context


## 3. Problems with pragmatics in NLP

We can divide the pragmatic context in Information Retrieval through looking at the types of information we need to get a search result:

* Basic Knowledge (common knowledge about general topics)
*For example:* If someone searches for "birth month cancer", the basic knowledge should lead to the zodiac sign and not the illness, because it is obviously a search request for the zodiac sign.
* User Information (which domains does the user normally search in)
*For example:* If someone tends to search for their horoscope every day, it is way more likely they want an article about the zodiac sign `Cancer` than the deadly illness. 
* Corpus Information (what information can be extracted from the corpus)
*For example:* If there is only information about zodiac sign `Cancer` in the corpus, it won't find anything about the illness.
