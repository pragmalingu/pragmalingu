## 1. What is Pragmatics?

Pragmatics is difficult to define in concrete terms. In linguistic research, there are various approaches to how pragmatics can be approached. 

On the one hand there is the Anglo-American component view on pragmatics, where pragmatics is defined as: 
>Pragmatics is the systematic study of meaning by virtue, or dependent on, the use of language. [(Huang 2007, 2013c, 2014:2, 2016)](https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&lr=&id=E04TDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=Huang,+Yan+(2007)+Pragmatics&ots=OvKgvYtXjw&sig=LQyOUgOPIXrZP9B3SptHBxLZzZQ)

Within this approach pragmatics exist in a linguistic theory where there are a number of core components like phonetics, phonology, morphology, synatx and semantics. Thomas C. Scott-Phillips illustrated this approach within his essay ["Pragmatics and the aims of language evolution"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1061-2):

  className= "contents"
/>

He defines pragmatics as the outermost and thus the most abstract layer of a language. According to Scott, pragmatics carries the meaning of a statement in the context of the conversation.

On the other hand there is the European Continental view on pragmatics, where pragmatics is defined as:
> Pragmatic is a general function (i.e. cognitive, social, and cultural) perspective on linguistic phenomena in relation to their usage in forms of behaviour. [(Verschueren 1999:7, 11, 1995:12)](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/rg/ipra/research/publications/books/)

We can profit from both of these approaches to get an understanding of the concept pragmatics.

As a conclusion we can create this very simple definition:
>Pragmatics is the study of language use in context. [(Huang, 2016)](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697960.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697960?rskey=tO58NA&result=1)

In order to understand pragmatic contexts, it is not enough to just look at a sentence, it is always necessary to consider the contextual circumstances as well.
In this article will use mostly the Anglo-American structure to explain some of the central concepts of pragmatics.

## 2. Central concepts of pragmatics

To find a useful way to handle the language given pragmatic concepts in Information Retrieval and NLP in general, we have to find rules to represent those concepts. In order to do that it is helpful to categorize them given the situation they appear in. 

In combination of ["The Oxford Handbook of Pragmatics"](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697960.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697960?rskey=tO58NA&result=1) and Stephen C. Levinson's book ["Pragmatics"](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/pragmatics/6D0011901AE9E92CBC1F5F21D7C598C3#overview) we tried to divide pragmatics into the following central concepts: 

* Conversational Implicature
* Presupposition
* Speech Acts
* Reference and Deixis
* Conversational Structure and Politolinguistics 

In the following, we will briefly explain those concepts using mainly ["The Oxford Handbook of Pragmatics"](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697960.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697960?rskey=tO58NA&result=1) as well as a few other sources listed in the [further reading](#4-further-reading) section. We will give you some examples to explain how those concepts work and why pragmatic search is still a major problem in Natural Language Processing.

### 2.1. Conversational Implicature
The conversational implicature can be defined as an additional meaning of an statement that is not apparent from the literal meaning but must be inferred from the context. 

*For example:*
>A: "I'm out of milk." <br></br>
>B: "There's a supermarket next door."

The answer B gives A doesn't make sense if you're not aware of the fact, that you can find milk inside a supermarket. Therefor it is implicated by B that A has this knowledge and knows what to do with it concerning A's sentence.

This shows that a conversational implicature is part of what a speaker means, but not part of what the sentence means.

The *implicature* shouldn't be mixed up with the term  *implication*. *Implication* is a term used in semantics to represent connections that can be concluded without any context but from having some basic knowledge. 

*For example:*
> "The cat lies on the carpet."

This implies that the carpet lies under the cat. The only knowledge we need to comprehend this implication is, how to revert this sentence semantically. 

Paul Grice's defined the cooperative principle through his pragmatic theory and introduced its attendant maxims of conversation in his book ["Studies in the Way of Words"](https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&lr=&id=QqtAbk-bs34C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=Paul+Grice+Studies+in+the+Way+of+Words+1989&ots=QssjdgVwsa&sig=MTa3ttSMpk8-qv3_VMAltsRJjeE#v=onepage&q=Paul%20Grice%20Studies%20in%20the%20Way%20of%20Words%201989&f=false). **The cooperative principle** implies that when we communicate, we are effective and cooperative and assume the same from our conversational partner. The four maxims are rules which can predict how to stay true to the cooperative principle:

1. **Maxim of quantity** is about being informative. 
<br></br>One should make their utterance as informative as the current conversation purpose requires, but not more than that.
2. **Maxim of quality** is about being truthful. 
<br></br>This means one shouldn't say anything they think is false, but also shouldn't say anything they can't give adequate reasons for its truth.
3. **Maxim of relation** is about being relevant. 
<br></br>One shouldn't say anything that isn't relevant to the conversation.
4. **Maxim of manner** is about being clear. 
<br></br>This means obscure language, ambiguity, prolixity should be avoided and proper language used.

By following the cooperative principle we're able to make conclusions and thus implicature. 
Often those maxims are broken on purpose, to get a specific effect.

1. **Violation of the quantity maxim**
* Tautologies: "It is what it is", "voll und ganz"
2. **Violation of the quality maxim**
* Irony/sarkasm: "Oh great..."
* Understatement/overstatement: "I was barely drunk after all.", "This will take ages."
* Lying
3. **Violation of the relation maxim**
* Sudden change of subject
* Evasion: "What is the capital of Germany?" - "It is not Paris."
4. **Violation of the manner maxim**
* Euphemism: "I'm not mad. I'm just ... well, differently moraled, that's all."
* Obscure language: "Where were you? Did you get milk?" - "Maybe I did, maybe I didnt't."

These maxims are not an ideal categorization but they can help to understand implicature and to determine the problems with it in NLP.

### 2.2. Presupposition

Presupposition can be defined as the implicit assumption that the counterpart has a certain knowledge about a given statement.

*Examples:*

* Lisa stopped going to the gym.<br></br>
Presupposition: *Lisa was going to the gym.*
* Are you vegan now?<br></br>
Presupposition: *You didn't eat vegan before.*
* Did you meet up with Louisa?<br></br>
Presupposition: *Louisa exists.*

Linguistic research tries to distinguish between semantic and pragmatic presupposition. While the semantic presupposition focuses on the truth of a statement, the pragmatic presupposition is concerned with whether a statement is adapted to the world knowledge of the counterpart.

Thus, in the case of "Joe Biden won the US election." the semantic presupposition would be that there is a person named "Joe Biden" and that there is an election in the US. The pragmatic presupposition, on the other hand, would be that the writer of the sentence assumes that the receiver knows who Joe Biden is.

It is often difficult to separate the semantic and pragmatic presuppositions because they often go together. Therefore, it is useful to consider both equally.

To detect a presupposition in written text, one can look for certain lexical items or linguistic constructors that trigger a presupposition. 
The following were defined by Stephen C. Levinson in his book ["Pragmatics"](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/pragmatics/6D0011901AE9E92CBC1F5F21D7C598C3#overview):

| Presupposition trigger      | Description | Example | Presupposition |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Definite descriptions       | A noun-phrase or a singular common noun with a proper description. | "The king of France is old."           | There is exactly one person who is the king of France. |
| Factive verbs               | Verbs that assume that their object, mostly subclauses, are a fact. (e.g. be aware of, regret that, realized that, be sorry that, be glad that, etc.) | "Julia realized that she was in debt." | Julia is in fact in debt. |
| Implicative verbs           | Verbs that imply an underlying attempt. (e.g. happened that, managed to, forgot to, avoided to, etc.) | "The politician did not win the election." | The politician ran for office. |
| Change of state             | Verbs that imply a change of a previous situation. (e.g. start, finish, etc.) | "He stopped smoking." | He did smoke before. |
| Iteratives                  | These imply a previous existence of a situation. (e.g. again, another time, return, repeat, etc.)    | "They met again."    | They met once before.   |
| Temporal clauses            | Clauses that explain background situation on the following sentence. (e.g. after, during, while, since, before, etc.)     | "While she was working, he was sick at home."   | She is working.   |
| Cleft sentences             | Sentences that highlight certain information and declare it as background informative.    | "It was not Andrea, who murdered Harold."   | Harold has been murdered.   |
| Comparisons and contrasts   | Comparative constructions can imply background information about the compared object.    | "He is an even better golf player than Tiger Woods."   | Tiger Woods is a golf player.   |
| Counterfactual conditionals | Implying that something happened by negating it.   | "If she hadn't missed the stop sign, she'd still be here."   | She did miss the stop sign.   |
| Questions                   | Specific questions that are phrased to get a concrete answer.    | "Who is the Queen of England?"   | There is someone who is Queen of England.   |
| Possessive case             | Relations can imply the background information about possession.    | "Rosie's dog is very cute."   |  Rosie has a dog.  |

These triggers can be a helpful clue while processing texts that include presuppositions. The transitions between  pragmatic concepts can be fluid, as already mentioned in the previous section.

### 2.3. Speech Acts

Speech acts are one of the most important fields in pragmatics and for a long time were not taken into account as much as the other fields. This field analyzes which actions a speaker intends with what they say.

In ["The Oxford Handbook of Pragmatics"](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697960.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697960?rskey=tO58NA&result=1) speech acts are defined as follows:

>(...) speech acts are more like moves in chess, whose meanings are circumscribed by rules and expectations. Trying to understand how utterances can have these abstract action-like properties, how they are coded linguistically, and how we recognize them are some of the core issues in this domain.

Since many users make their queries intuitively by using speech acts and phrase their queries similar to their speech habit, this area can be particularly important for Information Retrieval. Especially with respect to the everyday use of search engines. 

In his book about pragmatics [Searle](https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&lr=&id=t3_WhfknvF0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=Searle,+John+R.+(1969).+Speech+Acts:+An+Essay+in+the+Philosophy+of+Language.+&ots=0UgSbRV8K8&sig=Mq-47bPgSwTeJJC8BHh82Jws87g#v=onepage&q=Searle%2C%20John%20R.%20(1969).%20Speech%20Acts%3A%20An%20Essay%20in%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Language.&f=false), following Austin(1962), differentiates four acts associated with speech as communication:

* **Utterance act:** The act of producing an utterance by means of phonological and grammatical rules of a language. <br></br>
*For example:* "Peter does smoke." as a spoken sentence

* **Propositional act:** The act of referring to things (reference) and ascribing properties to them (predication). <br></br>
*For example:*  "Peter smokes." Reference to Peter and attribution of the property of smoking.

* **Illocutionary act:** The function that predication acts take in communication. <br></br>
*For example:* Assertion that Peter smokes. (other examples would be inquiring, commanding, promising, etc.)

* **Perlocutionary act:** The consequences and effects of illocutionary acts. <br></br>
*For example:* Addressee believes that Peter smokes.


He further classifies the illocutionary acts into 5 categories:

| **Category** | **Function**                                                                   | **Example**                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Representatives    | Committed to the truth of the proposition expressed                            | "It's snowing right now."             |
| Directives         | Attempt to cause an action                                                     | "Pick that up, please!"               |
| Commissives        | Committing to a future action                                                  | "Promise me you won't do that again." |
| Expressives        | Expressing a mental state                                                      | "Thank you for your help."            |
| Declaratives       | Lead to a change of state of an entity in the structure of social institutions | "I quit!"                             |

It depends very much on the domain to what extent speech acts can play an important role in Information Retrieval. Since this is a rather complex field, it is always helpful to weigh up how much benefit you can get from it.

### 2.4. Reference and Deixis

Since reference and deixis are very close topics we decided to summerize them into one section. A reference is always dependent on the sentence in which it appears and can't be understood without context.

For example:
> "Are you there yet?" - "No, I'm still at the cafe."

Without any more information it is for example impossible to know where exactly "there" is.

We can divide the pragmatic reference into two categories:
* **Deictic** reference
* **Anaphoric** reference

**Deictic reference**
The word deixis is derived from ancient Greek and means "to show" (Indexicality is also often used instead of deixis). Deictic reference is always found outside of a text. Thus one can say that without an apparent textual context, a reference is most likely deictic.

A rough distinction is made between 5 categories of deixis:

* **Personal deixis**: concerns the identity of the conversation partners (pronominal system)<br></br>.
*For example:* "I, you, he, she, ..."

* **Social deixis**: forms of address<br></br>.
*For example:* "You", "ladies and gentlemen".

* **Temporal deixis**: concerns temporal orientation<br></br>.
*For example:* "today, yesterday, tomorrow, ..."

* **Local deixis**: concerns spatial orientation<br></br>.
Distinction into *positional* ("here, there, ...") and *dimensional* reference system ("in front of, behind of, left, right, above, below, ....")

* **Text and discourse deixis**: refers to parts of the preceding or following text<br></br>.
*For example:* "What I'm trying to say is that..."

Specifically local and tense deixis can vary greatly depending on the language. For example, in Japanese there are references to objects that vary according to speaker position: *koko, soko, asoko*.

**Anaphoric reference**
The word anaphoric is derived from Greek and means as much as "to carry up" or also "to refer to sth." (also see anaphor). An anaphoric reference refers to a preceding part of a sentence. This inner textual reference, can be inferred from the text without any special prior knowledge.

*For example*:

>A: "I met Lisa earlier. She looked really relaxed." 
B: "That's what I thought, too. I think she just came back from her vacation."

So from "Lena" to "she" is anaphoric, because we can get the reference from the text. The same goes for "That's (what I thought, too)" and "(I think she) just came back from vacation", which both refer to "She looked really relaxed". These are also anaphoric references.

Less common is the case of pre-reference, the so-called cataphoric reference or cataphor.

*For example*: "I should have known: The task is just too hard."

Other references that are difficult to fit into these two categories would be:

* proper nouns ("Montblanc", "Snowy"). 
* definite identifiers ("the highest mountain in Europe", "Tintin's dog")
* generic names ("cat") or substance names ("milk"), which only become referential in connection with other referential expressions ("our cat", "the milk over there")

While some of these references can be solved with looking at more surrounding text, there are some - for example those who refer to objects or persons outside of the text - which are nearly unsolvable without the right context.

### 2.6. Conversational Structure and Politolinguistics

Although these two topics are often handled separately in the literature, we have decided to combine conversation structure and political linguistics under one heading, since they do not play a separate role for our experiments.

**Conversation structure (also conversation analysis)**.
In conversation structure, we study and analyze how people carry on conversations with each other. 
Characteristics such as constitutivity, processuality, interactivity, methodicity, and pragmaticity are examined in more detail.
This analysis takes place on different levels, the factual level, action level, social level, appeal level, the modality of the conversation and the establishment of reciprocity.

**Politolinguistics (also Political Communication)**.
Political linguistics studies how language and politics function in various contexts. For example, it examines the relationship between language and the political system, language and the political process, and language and individual policy fields.

Both areas are mainly considered in the case of spoken language, which is why they are of little importance for extracting information from documents. One could consider them when searching typed conversations.

## 3. Problems with pragmatics in NLP

We can divide the pragmatic context in Information Retrieval through looking at the types of information we need to get a search result:

* Basic Knowledge (common knowledge about general topics)
*For example:* If someone searches for "birth month cancer", the basic knowledge should lead to the zodiac sign and not the illness, because it is obviously a search request for the zodiac sign.
* User Information (which domains does the user normally search in)
*For example:* If someone tends to search for their horoscope every day, it is way more likely they want an article about the zodiac sign `Cancer` than the deadly illness. 
* Corpus Information (what information can be extracted from the corpus)
*For example:* If there is only information about zodiac sign `Cancer` in the corpus, it won't find anything about the illness.
