Hello and welcome to PragmaLingu.

We are a community of people interested in researching Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions to optimize search processes. Our tools, guides and resources are for everyone to explore, measure and validate. 
We focus on experimenting with pragmatic solutions. Therefore we try to model knowledge and contexts in order to understand the underlying meaning of words.

To get a quick overview on all established methods from Natural Language Processing that have been collected so far, you can have a look at our [Comparisons](./comparisons/comparisons-intro.mdx) section.
If you want to test some methods yourself right away, have a look at our [Guides](./guides/guides-intro.mdx) section or try to run some of our [Experiments](./experiments/experiments-intro.mdx) step by step.

You can find more information about who we are and what we actually want here on our [About](.about/team.mdx) page.
