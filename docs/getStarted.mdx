Hello, and welcome to PragmaLingu.

We are a community interested in researching Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions for search. Our tools, guides, and resources are free for anyone to explore, use, and validate.
You can find more information about the project and who we are on our [About Page](about/team.mdx).

You can get a quick overview of the solutions we have evaluated so far in our [Comparisons Section](./comparisons/comparisons-intro.mdx). It provides  an introduction to the various solutions we have applied as well as our results.  These solutions are compared using standard search retrieval tasks.


If you would like to dive deeper into the methods and datasets we used to prepare our experiments you can check out our [Experiments Section](./experiments/experiments-intro.mdx). 
All of our code is provided as publicly-hosted colab notebooks that you can run step-by-step to validate our approach.

If you would like more information about these approaches or to read further into certain topics, go to our [Guides Section](./guides/guides-intro.mdx).
