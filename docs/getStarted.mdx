Hello and welcome to PragmaLingu.

We are a community interested in researching Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions for search. Our tools, guides and resources are for everyone to explore, use and validate.
You can find more information about the project and who we are on our [About](about/team.mdx) page.

You can get a quick overview of the solutions we evaluated so far on our [Comparisons](./comparisons/comparisons-intro.mdx) section. It gives you an introduction to the solution and the measurements that we took.
We compare these solutions in standard search retrieval tasks.

If you want to dive deeper into the methods and datasets we used to prepare our experiments you can check out our [Experiments](./experiments/experiments-intro.mdx) section. 
All the code is provided as public hosted colab notebooks that you run step by step to validate our approach.

If you want more information about these approaches or further reading on certain topics, go to our [Guides](./guides/guides-intro.mdx) section.
