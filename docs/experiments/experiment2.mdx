For our second experiment we connect the Notebook to an Elasticsearch instance and compare the standard Elasticsearch operator with Embeddings we get from BERT (Bi-Directional Encoder Representation from Transformer).
We described how the standard Elasticsearch operator works and how we implemented it in our first experiment.

<summary>Need a short summary?</summary>  

We implemented our search with a standard Elasticsearch method - [multi-match query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html) - which is a full-text search that comes with standard tokenization and an analyser. It searches only the given fields of the documents - in our case 'text' and 'title'. To gather our data, we looked only at the first 20 retrieved documents for any given search.
