Welcome to our Experiments section!

Here we test some already established methods and solutions step by step for you to reproduce yourself. 
The whole experiment is stored in Google Colab notebooks which you can find in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pragmalingu/experiments/tree/master). 
You can also click on the "Run it in Google Colab" buttons located after each code snippet.

If you're only interested in the results and what they mean, you can go to our [comparisons section](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/comparisons/comparisons-intro) where we analyze the results of the experiments and put them in context.

Our first experiment focused on stemming in search engines and how you can configure Elasticsearch so that you can index and search on documents with a specific stemming algorithm.
You can read more about stemming and the related concept of lemmatization on our [basic definition site](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/basic-definitions).

Our second experiment focused on transformer-based sentence embeddings and how you can use them with the new 
[KNN search feature](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/knn/) of Open Distro for Elasticsearch. If you want to learn more about what embeddings and transformers are, you can check out our [Guide on Embeddings and Transformers](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/embeddings-transformers) first.
