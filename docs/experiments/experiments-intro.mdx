Welcome to our Experiments section.

Here we test some of the already established methods and solutions step by step for you to reproduce yourself. Our articles try to evaluate and analyze why some solutions seem to work better than others. The whole experiment is stored in Google Colab notebooks which you can find in our Github repository.
