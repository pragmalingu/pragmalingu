Welcome to our Experiments section!

Here, we outline several step-by-step methods and solutions for you to try yourself.

All of the experiment data  is stored in Google Colab notebooks which you can find in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pragmalingu/experiments/tree/master). 
You can also click on the "Run it in Google Colab" buttons located after each code snippet.

If you're only interested in the results and what they mean, you can go to our [Comparisons Section](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/comparisons/comparisons-intro) where we have analyzed the results of the experiments and provided further context.

Our first experiment focused on stemming in search engines and how you can configure Elasticsearch to index and search documents with a specific stemming algorithm.
You can read more about stemming and the related concept of lemmatization on our [Basic Definitions page](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/basic-definitions).

Our second experiment focused on transformer-based sentence embeddings and how you can use them with the new 
[KNN search feature](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/knn/) of Open Distro for Elasticsearch. If you want to learn more about what embeddings and transformers are, you can check out our [Guide on Embeddings and Transformers](http://pragmalingu.de/docs/guides/embeddings-transformers) first.
