## 1. What is Stemming?
Stemming is the process of removing the alternating endings from words.  
The words **fish**, **fishing**, **fished** would all be reduced to their common word stem **fish**. 
This stem is then stored in the inverted index of the search engine instead of the original word at that position. 
When you search with either of the original words, your query is also stemmed and the search engine can find all documents that contain words with the same stem.  

There are two common approaches to implement stemming in search engines.  


### Algorithmic Stemming
The [Porter stemming alogrithm](https://snowballstem.org/algorithms/porter/stemmer.html) created by [Martin Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Porter) is one of the most popular algorithmic stemmers 
and used by default in the built in [language analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.12/analysis-stemmer-tokenfilter.html) in Elasticsearch.
Algorithmic stemmers are very fast and don't need alot of memory, because they only apply a set of rules, that represent the common rules how words are [inflected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection) in a specific language.  
Because there are always exeptions to a rule, an algorithmic stemmer might produce the same stem for words that have different meanings.
This error is called **overstemming**. 
Another error that can happen is called **understemming** and happens when two inflected words with different endings but the same meaning and stem are not reduced to the same stem.

### Dictionary Based Stemming
The second common approach to stemming is [dictionary based stemming](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/stemming.html#dictionary-stemmers).
Dictionary stemmers look up words in a dictionary before they remove their inflected endings and reduce them to their stem.
Dictionary stemmers should work better on iregular words or words that are similar but have different meanings.
They also should be able to reduce over and understemming and lead to better results than algorithmic stemmers.
In practice they often perform worse than algorithmic stemmers, because the freely available dictionaries are missing important words or are outdated.
Dictionary stemmers also have the draw back that their are slower and require more memory because they have to lookup all words in their dictionary.

### Comparison
In this comparison we are answering the following questions:
- How much does the relevancy of search results improve by using a stemmer?
- How good is the in Elasticsearch included hunspell stemmer performing with a free dictionary?

## 2. Results
The following are the results from our [first Experiment](/docs/experiments/experiment1). You can reproduce these results yourself if you follow the instructions on our [experiment section](/docs/experiments/).

**F1-Score**
<details>
<summary>What is "F1-Score"?</summary>  
The F1-Score measures a harmonic mean between Precision and Recall. Therefore we multiply Precision and Recall by two and divide it by the sum of Precision and Recall: <br />
`F1-Score=(2*Precision*Recall)/(Precision+Recall)`
This is the simplest way to balance both Precision and Recall, there are also other common options to weight them differently.

<br />
<br />


On all evaluation datasets except NPL, the algorithmic stemmer outperformed the standard analyzer as well as the hunspell token filter.
The achieved F1-Score gains over the standard analyzer in percentage points can be seen here:

<br /><br />
Depending on the use-case algorithmic stemming can lead to a 20% improvement in search result relevancy.
Hunspell stemming performs worse than algorithmic stemming on nearly all datasets and can even lead to worse results than no stemming.

The average F1-Score gains over all datasets are:

<img alt="F1-Score Gains" src={useBaseUrl('img/EXP1_F1-Score_Avg_Gains.png')} />

Using the stemmer token filter on english documents can therefore improve the f1 score by 10% on average.

## 3. Discussion

Looking at the f1 score fom our approaches we can see that both stemming approaches perform better than the standard baseline on most datasets.
Algorithmic stemming performs better than the standard analyzer on all datasets, it has the biggest gains on the CACM and NPL datasets.
Hunspell stemming performs worse than algorithmic stemming on most datasets except NPL where it performs slighlty better.
Hunspell stemming performs worse than the standard analyzer on the medline dataset.

The are a list of interesting questions that we can ask by just looking at these results:

1.   Why is algorithmic stemming performing better than the standard analyzer?
2.   Why is algorithmic stemming performing better than hunspell stemming?
3.   Why is hunspell stemming performing worse that the standard analyzer on the Medline dataset?
4.   Why is hunspell stemming performing better that the algorithmic stemmer on the NPL dataset?

We will try to answer these questions by breaking down the results on the individual query and word matches.

### Algorithmic stemming vs standard analyzer
We see from the gains figure that algorithmic stemming performs better than the standard analyzer on all testet datasets.
But how does the algorithmic stemmer achieve these results in practice?

We first use our search analysis tool to figure out the queries that demonstrate the biggest f1-score gains with the stemmer token filter.
The three queries with the biggest fscore difference are 62, 73 and 52. We will be looking at query 62:



Query 62: *FAST TRANSISTOR COUNTERS*

We first look at the disjoint true positives sets of the query results for both the algorithmic stemmer and standard analyzer. 
The highest ranked document for the algorithmic stemmer that is not present in the top k (20) result set of the standard analyzer is document nr. 8341.

The text of relevant document is: 
> nonsaturating pulse circuits using two junction transistors junction transistors are found to be fast enough for pulse applications if the collector voltage is 
> prevented from reaching zero switching times can be achieved with available types the required limiting action is effected by introducing diodes which terminate 
> the switching transients by their breakdown a two transistor binary counter is described

For the **algorithmic stemmer** the document is at position **2** and returns the following highlighted text:
> nonsaturating pulse circuits using two junction **transistors**  junction **transistors** are found to be **fast** (...)  a two **transistor** binary **counter** is described

The overall document score of **12.49** is the some of these individual word scores:

|Word   | Score   | Term Frequency   | Document Frequency |
|-------|---------|------------------|--------------------|
|fast   | 4.31    | 1                | 84                 |
|transistor | 4.22| 3                | 640                |
|counter   | 3.95 | 1                | 127                |




For the **standard analyzer** the same document is at position **33** and returns the following highlighted text:
> nonsaturating pulse circuits using two junction transistors  junction transistors are found to be **fast** is effected by introducing diodes which terminate the switching transients by their breakdown  a two **transistor**

The overall document score of **7.10** is the sum of these individual word scores:

|Word   | Score   | Term Frequency   | Document Frequency |
|-------|---------|------------------|--------------------|
|fast   | 4.31    | 1                | 84                 |
|transistor | 2.78| 1                | 479                |

We can see that for the standard analyzer the inflected word **counters** is not matched with the word **counter** in the document. 
The occurences of the word **transistors** is also not matched with the stem **transistor** used in the query and therefore the term frequency and score of the word is lower.
The document frequency is also lower, which normally leads to higher score, but cannot make up for the lower term frequency in this instance.

Just looking at the best ranked hunspell hit that is not present in the top 20 of the algorithmic stemmer hits doesn't explain to us why hunspell is performing better in this szenario.
We instead have to look at the disjoint set of false positives between those two stemmers.
The highest ranked document for the algorithmic stemmer is:

#### 4. Conclusion
## Abstract
To find out whether stemming can have a positive effect on search results, we compared the standard Elasticsearch to two of the built-in stemming methods. We used [these free available corpora](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/) hosted by the University of Glasgow to work on. How we parsed and analyzed them in advance, can be found in our [parsing guide](../guides/how-to-parse.mdx) and in our [data set guide](../guides/data-comparison.mdx). While experimenting we found out, that the stemming apparently only improved on some corpora and even seem to worsen some of the results. We have tried to analyze the possible reasons for this in this article. For a detailed description of all methods and data we used, take a look at our [stemming experiment](../experiments/experiment1.mdx).

## Results
To evaluate the results, we looked at the Precision, Recall and F1-Score values. We visualized them as bar charts and as a table. Check this results on your own by running it on our [Elasticsearch instance](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1APrjSN-wpWy5xX31akjaWz2xul647rYJ#scrollTo=tApgxGG-lbTG).

<details>
<summary>You need a short reminder on "Precision", "Recall" and "F1-Score"?</summary>  

**Recall** measures the probability that relevant documents are retrieved. <br />
`Recall = retrieved & relevant documents / documents labeled as relevant`

**Precision** measures the probability that retrieved documents are relevant to the search query. <br/>
`Precision = retrieved & relevant documents / retrieved documents`

**F1-Score** is a simple way to measure a middle score between Precision and Recall. <br />
`F1-Score=(2*Precision*Recall)/(Precision+Recall)`

## Analysis
Before we started experimenting on these basic approaches, we thought we would be able to achieve a large improvement in the search results by simply applying stemming methods.
However, we discovered that the effect of stemming varied greatly depending on the corpora.
For the **Cranfield** corpus, stemming - neither the algorithmic nor the dictionary approach -  had any significant influence on the results.

The results on the **CACM** and **Time** corpus showed a slight improvement from the *Stemmer Token Filter*, but hardly any from the *Hunspell Token Filter*. A clearer improvement could be seen for the corpora **CISI**, **LISA**, and **NPL**. The results for the *Hunspell Token Filter* or the *Stemmer Token Filter* again, depended on the corpus.

The **Medline** corpus only improved with the *Hunspell Token Filter*, which could possibly be explained by the fact that the dictionary covers many terms from the medical field. On the **ADI** corpus there was actually a significant deterioration in the results due to stemming. However, this can probably be explained by the small amount of data, since the **ADI** corpus is the smallest with only 84 documents.

## Conclusion

While looking more into the stemming approaches regarding the results we discovered that the *Stemmer Token Filter* seems to have trouble with overstemming more often than the *Hunspell Token Filter*. The *Hunspell Token Filter*, on the other hand, does not always provide only one mapping per word, but sometimes multiple stems, which can lead to problems with ambiguous queries.

Overall, it cannot be said that stemming generally improves search results. It seems to depend very much on the documents, as well as on the stemming method used, to what extent, if any, an improvement is visible.
